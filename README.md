Before you can participate in any official events you'll need to do a bit of paperwork. Downlaoad, fill out, sign, and turn in our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/uhmgreyhats/getting-started/blob/master/Grey%20Hats%20Computer%20Security%20and%20Ethics%20Agreement.docx) form to [Gerald Lau](glau@hawaii.edu).

## 2. Regular Meeting Time
For Spring 2017, meeting time TBD (feel free to contact us if we haven't put a time and date down by the end of the first week). Go through the double doors on the first floor. It'll be the last door on the right. If the door isn't open, knock. If no one answers, we're not there yet.

## 6. Basic Skills
The following are some essential skills to help you get started.

***How to Become a Hacker***

Being a hacker isn't about stealing everything and causing chaos, but about solving challenging problems in interesting ways. The following short video will give you the right mindset.

***Command Line***

The command line is what hackers use to interact with programs, so get comfortable with it.

***Programming Language***

Learning the basics of at least one programming language is essential.
C/C++ is common in hacker challenges, but Python is an excellent place to start.

***Netowrking***

Get familiar with the basics of networking and how the internet works.

***Linux***

Linux is the quintessential hacker operating system. There are a lot of distributions, though [Kali](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) has a lot of bells and whistles, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) is a good to one to get your feet wet with.

Check out [Linux Journey](linuxjourney.com) to learn about the operating system in detail, and use [ANCL mirror's](http://mirror.ancl.hawaii.edu/) hosted in the Pacific Ocean Science and Technology building for faster downlaods of OS images and repositories.

***Now What?***

Capture the Flag is the game of hackers. Check out [this](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/tools-of-trade-and-resources-to-prepare-in-a-hacker-ctf-competition-or-challenge/) article and [this](http://www.amanhardikar.com/mindmaps/Practice.html) site to find websites to practice at, and see what tools you'll need to succeed. 

We also have a self contained course that we're able to give to you to review on your own time, off-line, if you aren't going to have regular internet access, or just want a more structure experience. Just ask us and we'll send you the download link.
