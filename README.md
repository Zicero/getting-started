Before you can participate in any official events you'll need to do a bit of paperwork. Downlaoad, fill out, sign, and turn in our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/uhmgreyhats/getting-started/blob/master/Grey%20Hats%20Computer%20Security%20and%20Ethics%20Agreement.docx) form to [Gerald Lau](glau@hawaii.edu).

## 2. Regular Meeting Time
For Fall 2016, we meet every Monday 4:30pm at Keller 105, exluding holidays. Go through the double doors on the first floor. It'll be the last door on the right. If the door isn't open, knock. If no one answers, we're not there yet.

***Programming Language***

Learning the basics of at least one programming language is essential.
C/C++ is common in hacker challenges, but Python is an excellent place to start.

***Linux***

Linux is the quintessential hacker operating system. There are a lot of distributions, though [Kali](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) has a lot of bells and whistles, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) is a good to one to get your feet wet with.
